Some Fortran arrays allow for the customization of the array bounds.
Other arrays will allows have dimensions with a lower bound of 1. It
can be confusing to remeber which is which and forgetting can have
catastrophic consequences in the form of out-of-bounds array accesses.
The code in this directory produces the table below documenting the
scenarios of most interest in writing one application ([Morfeus]).
If you would like to add other table entries, please feel free to
submit a pull request with updated code.
